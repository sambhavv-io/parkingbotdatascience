# parkingbotai_datascience_python

To run the code setup using <br />
pip install -r requirements.txt <br />
python parkingbasicapi.py <br />

We are using langchain and openai to revert back user queries using exported data from mongoDB <br />
No cleaning has been done yet on the data. First we will run query testing and then get back to data cleaning and index_managment
